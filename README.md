# Hybird Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System using machine learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models for disease prediction based on patient data. The project compares the performance of Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Hybrid Algorithm combining both approaches. The objective is to identify the most accurate algorithm for disease prediction, which could be valuable for improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in healthcare settings.

## Features

- Comparison of Random Forest, KNN, and Hybrid Algorithm for disease prediction.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Implementation in Python using scikit-learn library.

### Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for the disease prediction analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook disease_prediction.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook/script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Results
```sh
- Random Forest: Accuracy = 85%, Error Rate = 15%
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy = 80%, Error Rate = 20%
- Hybrid Algorithm: Accuracy = 92% (Highest), Error Rate = 8% (Lowest)
```
## Future Work
